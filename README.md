# ðŸš€ React.js 7-Day Mastery Roadmap

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This roadmap will help you **master React.js in 7 days**, covering **90% of the essential concepts** used in most real-world projects. By the end of this roadmap, you'll have a **solid foundation in React** and will be ready for advanced topics like Next.js, Redux, and performance optimization.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 1: React Core Concepts & Setup
### âœ… Topics Covered:
- What is React.js and why use it?
- Setting up a React project (Vite / Create React App)
- Understanding components (`function`)
- JSX syntax and rendering elements
- Props: Passing data between components

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Understand the core philosophy of React.
- Set up a working React environment.
- Learn how components work and communicate.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 2: State Management & Events
### âœ… Topics Covered:
- `useState` for managing component state
- Handling user input and events (`onClick`, `onChange`)
- Two-way data binding in forms
- Conditional rendering (`if`, `ternary`, `&&`)
- List rendering using `.map()` and the importance of keys

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Master component-level state management.
- Learn how to handle user interactions dynamically.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 3: Side Effects & Data Fetching
### âœ… Topics Covered:
- Understanding `useEffect` for side effects
- Fetching data from APIs using `fetch()` & `axios`
- Cleanup functions in `useEffect` (handling memory leaks)
- Debouncing user input for better performance
- Handling loading and error states in API requests

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Learn how to fetch and display data in React.
- Understand how to manage side effects efficiently.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 4: React Forms & Validation
### âœ… Topics Covered:
- Controlled vs uncontrolled components
- Handling multiple form fields efficiently
- Form validation using `yup` or `react-hook-form`
- Handling form submission and preventing page reloads

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Build fully functional forms with validation.
- Master best practices for handling user input.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 5: Component Optimization & State Management
### âœ… Topics Covered:
- Performance optimizations (`React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`)
- Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
- Prop drilling problem and why we need Context API
- Using React Context API for global state
- When to use Redux and alternatives like Zustand

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Optimize React applications for better performance.
- Learn different ways to manage global state efficiently.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 6: React Router & Navigation
### âœ… Topics Covered:
- Installing and setting up `react-router-dom`
- Creating multiple pages with `Route` and `Switch`
- Navigating using `Link` and `useNavigate()`
- Dynamic routes (`useParams`) for handling product details or user profiles
- Protected routes (authentication-based routing)

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Implement client-side routing in React.
- Handle navigation dynamically and securely.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 7: Advanced Topics & Best Practices
### âœ… Topics Covered:
- Code splitting and lazy loading (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`)
- Error boundaries for handling component crashes
- Using custom hooks for reusability
- Understanding React reconciliation and the virtual DOM
- Building and structuring a scalable React project

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Learn best practices for building scalable applications.
- Prepare for advanced React concepts like SSR and Next.js.
